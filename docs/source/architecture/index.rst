Architecture
############

.. _architecture:

This architecture guide is the home for vision,
requirements (scenarios, use cases, functional and non-functional requirements)
as well as of architecture stuff.

Furthermore, the structure is rather arbitrary, established on the fly
rather than a "formal" requirement specification or architecture documentation

Nevertheless, it is the home to understand some backgrounds, ideas better.
